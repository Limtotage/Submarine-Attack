🚢 Submarine Attack

Submarine Attack is a 2D top-down arcade shooter inspired by classic space shooters, reimagined in an underwater setting.

The game was developed as part of a game jam, with a strong focus on keeping the scope small and polishing a single core mechanic:
move, shoot, and survive.

🎮 Gameplay

Classic arcade-style shooting

Enemy waves and obstacle-based sections

Deadly minefields that require precise movement

Power-ups and weapon upgrades

A single-use nuclear torpedo as a high-risk, high-reward mechanic

Retro-inspired visuals and juicy feedback

🌊 Theme & Inspiration

The project connects to the “Simpler Times” theme by embracing old-school arcade design principles:

Simple controls

Instant action

No complex systems or progression trees

It also draws inspiration from classic Flash games and early arcade shooters, blending them with a submarine-based setting.

🧠 Development Philosophy

This project was developed solo, primarily as a way to gain experience through game jams.

Sometimes I create small clones to better understand classic mechanics, and other times I experiment with original ideas.
Game jams allow me to challenge myself, work within strict time limits, and turn ideas into finished, playable games.
